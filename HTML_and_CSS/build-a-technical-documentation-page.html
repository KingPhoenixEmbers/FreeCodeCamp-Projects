        <p>Welcome to the world of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en">Magic the Gathering</a>!</p>
        <p>Magic the Gathering, commonly referred to as "Magic" or "MTG", is a trading card game of strategy and wits. It's open to everyone willing to give it a chance!</p>
        <p>Within this document, you will learn the basics of MTG.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Basics">
        <header>Basics</header>
        <p>Begin by setting aside space on a table, a desk, or anywhere you and at least one other person can spread out multiple cards. <br>
        Each player should have a pile of cards that they will draw from, called their "deck" or "library". <br>
        Everyone starts by shuffling their deck, then drawing seven cards for an opening hand. <br>
        Once everyone has settled on their hand, each player receives 20 "Life". <br>
        <strong>If this number reaches "0", or you run out of cards in your library, you lose.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>Next, let's identify sections of the play space. <br>
        Each player has their deck, next to which they have their discard pile, or "graveyard". Next to the graveyard is a second discard pile called "exile". Keep these separate. <br>
        The rest of the area in front of each player is their play area. This is where each player will place any cards that do not get immediately discarded. <br></p>
        <p>
        In MTG, using a card is usually known as "casting a spell".
        </p>
        <p>
          Any card that is cast from the hand and stays on the playing field is known as a "permanent".<br>
          Permanent cards have the card types of Land, Creature, Artifact, Enchantment, and Planeswalker. <br>
          Cards with types of "Sorcery" or "Instant" are <em>not</em> Permanent cards, and are discarded immediately after their effects occur.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Turn_Order">
        <header>Turn Order</header>
        <p>In MTG, a turn operates in "Phases", which occur in the following order:</p>
        <div id="beginning_phase">
          <ol id="Turn_Order_Phases">
            <li>Untap</li>
              <span>This is when any card that was "tapped" becomes "untapped".</span>
            <li>Upkeep</li>
              <span>Utilize any card effects that occur at this time.</span>
            <li>Draw</li>
              <span>Draw your one (1) card for the turn. Some cards allow you to draw more than one (1) card at this time.</span>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="first_main">
          <ol start="4">
            <li>First Main Phase</li>
              <span>You may play Lands (one per turn), cast any spell or sorcery, and activate abilities.
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="combat_phase"> 
          <ol start="5">
            <li>Combat</li>
              <span>Combat is when you decide to have one or more creature attack one or more opponent. See below for further information. </span>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="second_main">
          <ol start="6">
            <li>Second Main Phase</li>
              <span>After combat, you may play Lands (if you have not already), cast spells, or activate abilities.</span>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="end_turn">
          <ol start="7">
            <li>End Turn</li>
            <li>Clean-Up</li>
              <span>At this point, if your hand contains more than 7 cards, discard cards until you have only 7. <br>
              Any cards that have "Until End of Turn" effects active, those effects end here.</span>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Mana_and_Casting_Cards">
        <header>Mana and Casting Cards</header>
        <p>Mana is MTG's primary resource, and is used to cast spells or activate abilities. <br>
          To obtain Mana, you must "tap" a Land or other Mana-producing permanent. "Tapping" a card is done by announcing it, and turning the card sideways. <br>
            <em>Tapped cards do not untap until your next turn.</em> <br>
            Mana goes into what is called your "mana pool". Your mana pool empties at the end of each step in your turn, and at the end of each phase. <br>
             Keep this in mind when casting spells or activating abilities!
        </p>
        <p>Casting cards is done by utilizing mana and showing the card you are casting.<br>
        When you cast a Creature, it is usually affected by "Summoning Sickness". This means that it cannot attack or activate any abilities until your next turn.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Combat">
        <header>Combat</header>
        <p>When you decide to have one (or more) of your Creatures attack one (or more) opponent, you engage in Combat.
          Combat has several steps to it, which you or another player can "respond" to:
          <ol class="combat_steps">
            <li>Entering Combat</li>
              <span>You should announce that you are entering combat.</span>
            <li>Declare Attackers</li>
              <span>Choose one, or more, Creatures to attack an opponent with.</span>
            <li>Declare Blockers</li>
              <span>If you are being attacked, you can choose to block with Creatures of your own - but you are <em>not required</em> to block.</span>
            <li>First/Double Damage (if applicable)</li>
              <span>Creatures with "First Strike" or "Double Strike" deal damage before other creatures.</span>
            <li>Regular Combat Damage</li>
              <span>Creatures normally deal damage here. Creatures with "Double Strike" deal damage here as well.</span>
            <li>End of Combat</li>
              <span>Combat ends.</span>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Common_Keywords">
        <header>Common Keywords</header>
        <p>MTG cards have "Keywords", words that refer to specific abilities. <br>
        Some of these keywords are considered common enough to no longer require an explanation. <br>
        Below is a list of the most common keywords and what they mean.
        </p>
        <ul class="keywords_list">
          <li class="keywords"><code>Deathtouch</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">Any amount of damage dealt by this creature is considered lethal to the blocking creature.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>Double Strike</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">Creatures deal their damage twice, both in the "Double Damage" combat step <em>and</em> in the "Regular Combat Damage" step.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>Equipment</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">A card that can be "equipped" to another card, usually a creature, to provide an additional effect.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>First Strike</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">Creatures deal their damage only once, but before creatures that <em>do not</em> have First Strike.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>Flying</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">Creatures with Flying can only be blocked by creatures with Flying or Reach.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>Haste</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">A creature is not affected by summoning sickness. This means it can attack or activate its abilities immediately.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>Lifelink</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">Any damage this creature deals damage increases your Life by the same amount.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>Reach</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">Creatures with Reach are able to block creatures with Flying.</span>
            <li class="keywords"><code>Trample</code></li>
            <span class="keyword_desc">If this creature deals damage, and there is damage left over from any blockers, the damage still affects the opponent.</span>
